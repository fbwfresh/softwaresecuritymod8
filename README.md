final submission for this course

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

- Artemis Financial is a financial services company specializing in wealth management and investment solutions. They approached me with concerns about their software's security, which they suspected was vulnerable to breaches that could compromise client financial data and regulatory compliance. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, improve security, and maintain the software's functionality.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

- I effectively identified Artemis Financial's software vulnerabilities by performing a systematic analysis, leveraging automated tools like vulnerability scanners, and manually reviewing the code for common flaws (e.g., SQL injection or insecure authentication). My ability to prioritize fixes based on the potential impact ensured efficient resolution. Secure coding is vital because it prevents data breaches, protects the company's reputation, and builds customer trust. Software security also strengthens operational continuity, ensuring the business can confidently scale without significant risks.
  
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

- The most challenging part of the assessment was balancing security enhancements with the software's performance and user experience. Identifying deeply embedded flaws required additional time and collaboration. However, this experience enhanced my ability to approach complex systems holistically and taught me the importance of iterative security improvements.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

- To increase the layers of security, I implemented the following measures:
Input Validation: Ensured data integrity by sanitizing inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Data Encryption: Applied encryption protocols to secure sensitive information in transit and at rest.
Secure Authentication and Authorization: Strengthened login systems with multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

- To ensure the refactored code was both functional and secure, I conducted:
Unit Testing and Integration Testing: Verified that new features and fixes worked as intended.
Penetration Testing: Simulated attacks to validate defenses.
Code Reviews: Collaborated with peers to identify blind spots and confirm compliance with security best practices.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

- A resource/tool that I used that will definitely be more helpful in the foreseeable future is the OWASP Dependency check.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

 - To showcase my skills, I would present:
Documentation: Detailed findings on vulnerabilities, including their impact and resolutions.
Metrics: Before-and-after comparisons demonstrating improved security and performance.
Refactored Code: A secure, functional software product that exemplifies my ability to integrate security without compromising usability.
